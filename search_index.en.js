developer's perspective rather than a functional programming enthusiast. I will discuss why one would want to use it and how to recognize when it is applicable.\n\nWhen I first saw breakOut, it seemed like an extremely intimidating concept and a little like black magic. It certainly didn't help that I found explanations of breakOut intermingled with the equally intimidating concept of CanBuildFrom. This is a shame because, with proper application, breakOut can make your code run faster. Let's consider the following code sample:\nThe full code sample can be found at github.\nWhy we care\nval list = List(\"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\")\n\nval expensiveMap = list      //type Map[Int, String] is infered by the compiler\n  .map(n =&gt; n.length -&gt; n)     //1\n  .toMap                    //2\n\nThe problem with this code is that it is memory inefficient. We first create an intermediate list at line (1) and then convert it to a Map on line (2). Ideally we could do it all in one step. Well thanks to breakOut we can!\nimport scala.collection.breakOut\nval list = List(\"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\")\n\nval efficientMap: Map[Int, String] = list   //you need to specify the type\n  .map(n =&gt; (n.length, n))(breakOut)\n\nThis results in the Map we want without the intermediate list. Win!\nWhen to use\nSo when should we use breakOut? An easy way to remember when to use it is if we have the following list of conditions:\n\nwe have a traversable collection (List, Seq, Vector)\nwe want to transform the elements (pairing the string length with the string)\nwe want the final output to be a Map\n\nConclusion\nScala has a robust immutalbe collections library, which has a tendency to make it more GC heavy. However, with some attention to the implementation details, it is possible to remain efficient and functional.\n","id":"http://toidiu.com/blog/a-practical-guide-to-breakout/","title":"A practical guide to breakOut"},"http://toidiu.com/blog/android-low-memory-testing/":{"body":"There are a few things that separate mobile development from other types of development. Yes, actually your code does have to be smaller (in the previous version of the Android compiler, there was a limit on the number of methods that your application could have)... but really you are dealing with two main struggles; loss of network connectivity, and low memory. We will focus on the low memory issue and how you can go about testing this ephemeral state.\n\nOut of sight, out of mind\nIt is often easy to ignore a problem that is unlikely to occur. Of course as the consumer market steadily moves towards more powerful phones, low memory issue should be a thing of the past. However, if each app developer thinks along these lines then we make no progress. Additionally, low memory issues can happen quite often: start a camera intent, or the user navigates to another app and then comes back.\nLiving on the edge: destroy everything\nEnable the setting: Settings -&gt; Developer options -&gt; Don't keep activities. By checking this option Android will simulate low memory behavior, and destroy each activity as the user navigates away from it. This is what the OS does to reclaim memory and can result in invalid state within or loss of state.\nThe Good news\nAndroid actually gives you a lot (such as views), when you return to an activity that was destroyed. However if you are setting field variables then its upon you to restore those. Use the method onSaveInstanceState() to save any variables and onRestoreInstanceState() to restore the variables back.\nHappy developing :)\n","id":"http://toidiu.com/blog/android-low-memory-testing/","title":"Android low memory testing"},"http://toidiu.com/blog/announcing-reads/":{"body":"I am starting an ongoing project/section here called reads.

Possibly other might also find this useful.\n\nLink: reads\n","id":"http://toidiu.com/blog/announcing-reads/","title":"Announcing Reads"},"http://toidiu.com/blog/learning-scala/":{"body":"Learning a new technology/language is difficult, and it can seem daunting when getting started. This is the third time in 3 years that I have set out to learn something new and become proficient, so I wanted to share my experience on how I learned Scala and built SubwayTunesu.\n\nThe code if now available on github.\nCheatsheet / tl;dr\nSome of the technology behind SubwayTunes includes the Play Framework, ReactiveMongo, Docker, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS S3.\nI have many people who helped me accomplish this task. Here is a list of resources I used to help me learn Scala and Play Framework in no particular order:\n\nScala for the Impatient for basic Scala syntax.\nFunctional Programming in Scala and the accompanying solutions. A great book that uses exercises to re-enforce concepts in Scala. I recommend reading as much of this book as possible and attempting the exercises yourself first.\nEbook - amazingly through and yet concise. Great reference for all levels.\nLook at other's code - don't worry about all the setup and just git clone and use activator run to launch.\nCoursera class taught by the master. Coursera classes are not for me but the course offers great sources and I do recommend it.\nNYC Scala Meetup\n\nWhy?\nOnce a doctor graduates from Medical school, he or she has the responsibility to stay up to date with new developments in the field, by reading publications and attending conferences. Similarly, as software engineers, I believe it is our responsibility to stay current with new technology and best practices. You wouldn't build a Flash app for a website, would you?\nIdea\nWhen attempting to learn a new technology, the biggest barrier you will face is frustration and becoming overwhelmed. For this reason, it is important to supplement your technical learning with practical application. Doing so will allow you to switch contexts if one task becomes too tedious and help mitigate your frustration.\nIn my experience, having a tangible project is critical for successful follow-through. Better yet, choose an idea that is relevant to your daily life or your interests. Maybe you hate waking up in the morning...so make an alarm app.\nPlay\nSpend some time setting up your environment and then write some code. There are plenty of resources to help you get started and write something more significant than a \"Hello World!\". Find a sample project on Github and get it to build. Then start tinkering with it.\nThe idea behind starting with a sample is to see a finished product in action and whet your appetite. You may not be able to accomplish much else, but thats ok.\nMeet\nImagine wanting to be a chef and having Alton Brown show you how to perfect a recipe that he tried last week. That is the power of a good Meetup: being able to speak with some of the top professionals in the industry. Not only are you exposing yourself to the opportunity to network but also absorbing the jargon and best practices relevant to your project.\nThe biggest risk of attempting to learn something by yourself, is to waste time learning the wrong thing or just figuring out what to learn in the first place. A book can be a great resource, but it can quickly become outdated, especially in the field of software. My advice is to attend a few Meetups on the topic and see if one or two stand out. Then attend regularly for some time. I find myself feeling more motivated each time I attend a Meetup.\nAsk\nWhen at a Meetup, don't simply go for the organized talks. Ask people for recommendations on relevant books, tutorials, videos, conferences, and even other Meetups. Chances are, the people you meet have been in the same position as you are and can help you save weeks of guessing. Remember, you want to avoid wasting time as much as possible.\nRepeat\nExpect to get stuck. It takes years to be an expert at any technology. The goal is not to be perfect, but to keep stepping forward. You are bound to stumble across the finish like eventually! Switch between expanding your technical knowledge and project implementation. After gaining the preliminary knowledge, try your best to break your learning into discrete steps so that each new step helps you accomplish a piece of your project.\nYou might find yourself getting frustrated trying to achieve perfect implementation. Stop yourself. Just write something that works. I guarantee that regardless of what you write, it will change 2-3 times before the end of the project anyway.\n","id":"http://toidiu.com/blog/learning-scala/","title":"Learning Scala"},"http://toidiu.com/blog/polymorphism-in-scala/":{"body":"Polymorphism is a word that means 'having  different forms'. In terms of OOP, this mean that a class can have many different forms and behave in different manners depending on the context. Scala has 3 types of Polymorphism that we will explore further below.\n\n\nSubtype Polymorphism\nParametric Polymorphism\nAd-hoc Polymorphism\n\n\nAs an extra bit of info, the compiler evaluates subtype at Runtime\nwhile parametric and ad-hoc are evaluated at compile time.\n\nI have found that I learn much better when I have to write about it and explain it to others. This is an exercise for my understanding but hopefully it will also help others. The accompanying code for this post can be found on github.\nSubtype Polymorphism\nIn Java we have subtype polymorphism and this is the one that most people learn about. This is when we define a super/parent class or interface(traits in Scala) and then extend this behavior in a child class. In the example below, we can think of Taco as a sub-type of the type Food.\n//Define a trait that other child classes can extend. We could also have declared Food as an abstract class.\ntrait Food {\n  final val isEdible = true\n  def name: String\n  def minToPrep: Int\n}\n\nclass Taco extends Food {\n  val name: String = \"taco\"\n  def minToPrep: Int = 6\n}\n\nclass Cereal extends Food {\n  val name: String = \"cereal\"\n  def minToPrep: Int = 1\n}\n\nval t = new Taco\nval c = new Cereal\n\nt.isEdible //true\nc.isEdible //true\nt.minToPrep //6\nc.minToPrep //1\n\nAs seen from the example above, both Taco and Cereal are child classes that extend the behavior of trait Food.\ndef whatsForLunch(f: Food) {\n  println(f.name)\n}\n\nwhatsForLunch(new Taco) //prints: taco\n\nWe can now substitute instances of Taco for a value that requires Food. A way to think about this is that by extending the class Food, Taco essentially guarantees that it will fulfill a contract and define the values isEdible and minToPrep; and therefore makes a perfectly acceptable substitute for Food.\nIn this case we define the value for isEdible as true for all foods. However, the name and minToPrep value is customized based on the different types of food.\nAs a note, sub-type polymorphism is determined at Runtime. The type of the class is looked up at Runtime and then the appropriate method is called. For more information about this read the Wikipedia article on Dynamic Dispatch.\nParametric Polymorphism\nIn Java the name for parametric polymorphism is 'Generics'. The idea is to create data structures and write code that can be generic or type agnostic. A good example to demonstrate this is List. Below we construct a List for holding Int which doesn't use parametric polymorphism.\ntrait List\n\nobject Nil extends List {\n  val isEmpty = true\n}\n\nclass Cons(val head: Int, val tail: List) extends List {\n  val isEmpty = false\n}\n\nval list = new Cons(2, new Cons(1, Nil)) //list {2-&gt;1-&gt;Nil}\nprintln(list.head)  //prints: 2\n\nThe above code is fine if we only want to create a list of Int but we quickly run into problems when we want to create a list of String, Long, Taco!! We now have to re-write the same code and create multiple copies for each data type.\n\nThis violates the DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) principle of good\nprogramming. To understand the reason behind DRY, just consider\nwhat happens if we want to now add a method to append lists\ntogether. We would have to add the same code to the implementation\nfor each type of List.\n\nInstead we could re-write List data structure using parametric polymorphism, in a more generic manner(pun intended :P).\ntrait List[+A]\n\nobject Nil extends List[Nothing]\n\nclass Cons[A](val head: A, val tail: List[A]) extends List[A]\n\n\nval intList = new Cons(2 , new Cons(1 , Nil)) //list of Int\nval foodList: List[Food] = new Cons(new Taco, new Cons(new Cereal, Nil)) //list of food\n\n\nThe + sign on the definition of the List declares List structure\nas covariant. This means that if we declare a list of Food\nval list = List[Food] we can add Taco and Cereal to the list.\n\nThe advantages are obvious... we can define the List data structure once and utilize it with any type of object!\nAd-hoc Polymorphism\nLet me admit, this one was confusing for me. Therefore I will first explain the concept in plain english to get a general understanding. I will then demonstrate the concept with code and relate it back to the english definition.\nWikipedia defines ad-hoc polymorphism as follows:\n\nAd hoc polymorphism is a kind of polymorphism in which\npolymorphic [1]functions can be applied to arguments of\ndifferent types, because a polymorphic function can\n[2]denote a number of distinct and potentially heterogeneous\nimplementations [3]depending on the type of argument(s)\nto which it is applied. It is also known as function\noverloading or operator overloading... This is in [4]contrast\nto parametric polymorphism, in which polymorphic functions\nare written without mention of any specific type, and can\nthus apply a single abstract implementation to any number of\ntypes in a transparent way.\n\n\n\nAn ad-hoc polymorphic function can take different types of arguments. ex. Int or String.\n\n\nThe implementation of the ad-hoc polymorphic function function can vary.\n\n\nCombining points 1 and 2, the implementation of the function will vary depending on the type of the argument passed to the function.\nThats really it! Another way to think about this is that we are doing function overloading and the function does different things based on the type we pass it.\n\n\nThe statement helps us to differentiate ad-hoc from parametric polymorphism. Remember from before, in parametric polymorphism the implementation of the function(List constructor) was the same regardless of the type passed in.\n\n\nSome code:\nWe first define a Texture trait and a function that prints the Texture. Note: printTexture is our ad-hoc polymorphic function. printTexture takes a type parameter t: T and a texture implementation of that type o: Texture[T].\nAhh ha.. from bullet (1), the function takes different types as arguments.\n\nIgnore the implicit keyword for now. I will how this is later used\nto automatically pull in the correct implementation of Texture.\n\ntrait Texture[T] {\n  def getTexture(t: T): String\n}\n\ndef printTexture[T](t: T)(implicit o: Texture[T]): Unit = {\n  println(o.getTexture(t))\n}\n\nNext we need to define the different implementation depending on the the class type. Note how in the Texture object we define TacoTexture and WetTacoTexture which define the texture for the class Taco that we defined above.\nWe also define a new class called Silk which can also have a texture and give it a texture implementation SilkTexture.\nAhh ha.. from bullet (2), we have varying definitions based on the types.\n\nAgain notice but ignore the implicit keyword. We will make the\nconnection later.\n\n//A new class for which we will define texture\nclass Silk\n\nobject Texture {\n  implicit object TacoTexture extends Texture[Taco] {\n    override def getTexture(t: Taco) = \"crunchy\"\n  }\n\n  object WetTacoTexture extends Texture[Taco] {\n    override def getTexture(t: Taco) = \"soggy\"\n  }\n\n  implicit object SilkTexture extends Texture[Silk] {\n    override def getTexture(s: Silk) = \"soft\"\n  }\n}\n\nWe can now create instances of Taco and Silk and pass them to our ad-hoc polymorphic function printTexture. The function, depending on the type prints the appropriate texture!\nNow you might be asking how did printTexture get the appropriate implementation for Texture? The answer is implicits; we import the implicits with the statement import Texture._ and the Scala compiler takes care of the rest. Note, however that we can always provide the Texture[T] explicitly and get the desired implementation.\n\nI should also mention that we can only have one type of\nimplicit definition in the same scope because otherwise the\nScala compiler get mad. ex. We don't declare WetTacoTexture as\nan implicit.\n\nAhh ha.. we demonstrate bullet (3), the function implementation varies depending on the type!!\nimport Texture._\n\nval taco = new Taco\nprintTexture(taco) //prints: crunchy\nval silk = new Silk\nprintTexture(silk) //prints: soft\n\n//explicitly declare the Texture[Taco] implementation\nprintTexture(taco)(WetTacoTexture) //prints: soggy\nDifferent Syntax:\nAs an extra bit let's look at another way we can write our ad-hoc polymorphism function. The Scala compiler provides syntactical sugar so that we can re-write the function as follows. So don't get confused when you see either representation.\n//def printTexture[T](t: T)(implicit o: Texture[T]): Unit = {\n//  println(o.getTexture(t))\n//}\n\n\ndef printTexture[A: Texture](t: A): Unit = {\n  val o = implicitly[Texture[A]]\n  println(o.getTexture(t))\n}\nAddendum\nThanks to Wil Lee for clarifying this and highlighting the power of Ad-hoc polymorphism.\nYou might have noticed something cool about ad-hoc polymorphism; at no point did we modify the class Food and yet we were able to give it a Texture! Ad-hoc polymorphism allows us to extend the functionality of a piece of code, even if we don't have access to the source (library, legacy code).\nAnd to quote Wil, who explains it eloquently:\n\nWith Java interfaces / Scala traits, you can't claim that some type implements such an interface unless you have access to that type's source code and can modify it. With ad-hoc polymorphism, you don't need to be able change the type's source code. Using your post's example, Taco and Silk can come from some 3rd party library, and due to the implicit pattern you can still define a Texture for them.\n\n","id":"http://toidiu.com/blog/polymorphism-in-scala/","title":"Polymorphism in Scala"},"http://toidiu.com/blog/understanding-lambda-in-rust/":{"body":"Given the announcement of the Lambda runtime, there is now an officially supported story around writing lambda functions in Rust. I wanted to try for myself and see the amount of effort needed to get a lambda function working, while also diving deeper into whats involved.\n\nThis blog post describes how to use the lambda runtime to create a lambda function in Rust, so I wont detail the actual process. Instead I will try to expand on what is actually happening behind the scenes and reasons for certain steps.\nHere is some code that creates and invokes a lambda function.\nWhy we need \"[[bin]] bootstrap\" and \"autobins = false\"\nSince we are going to include a custom runtime(tokio runtime), we need the executable to be called 'bootstrap'. These settings allow us to dictate these settings.\nWhat is \"glibc\" and \"musl\" and whats the difference\nThis is a much larger topic but I will try to cover the relevant pieces. A computer comprises of layers of abstractions. So for example, if we wish to execute a task in our application, we request a thread from the kernel, which schedules our task to run on a core.\n  hardware(cores) &lt;-&gt; kernel(thread management) &lt;-&gt; user space(application)\n\nSo to access resources of a computer we need to communicate with the kernel. The kernel in turn exposes the API via a C standard called the libc. glibc (GNU C Library) and musl are two different implementations of this standard.\nglibc is the most commonly supported libc but Amazon instances require musl. From it's site: musl is lightweight, fast, simple, free, and strives to be correct in the sense of standards-conformance and safety.\nstatic vs dynamic lib\nI was not able to figure out if the musl lib is statically or dynamically linked. If I had to guess, I would say it is dynamically linked so as not to bloat the size of our lambda function. Additionally, since all functions should be targeting musl, it doesn't make sense to include it with each function.\nwhat is a lambda runtime?\nThe lambda! macro takes an optional field: tokio runtime. As per docs creating a runtime does the following:\n\nSpawn a background thread running a Reactor instance.\nStart a ThreadPool for executing futures.\nRun an instance of Timer per thread pool worker thread.\n\nOne can imagine configuring a runtime to specify the number of threads. Configuration options for the tokio runtime can be found in docs\nBtw, as per AWS docs there is a default limit of 1024 threads/processes per function.\nWhy we need target.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl\nThe amazon linux instances require musl. For reference here is a list of all the target that the Rust compiler supports!\nWhy we need linker = \"x86_64-linux-musl-gcc\"\nWe need to download the linker so that we can locally compile for the musl target.\nConclusion\nThe smart folks at AWS have done a lot to make developing for lambda easy. However, it is always nice to understand where and how our code is actually running... yes, event in the world of lambda. In a future post I hope to explore firecracker, the micro-vm(yup written in Rust) where all lambda functions run.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/comments/41q2m9/eli5_what_is_musl_and_glibc/cz4cy3k\n\n\n","id":"http://toidiu.com/blog/understanding-lambda-in-rust/","title":"Understanding Lambda in Rust"},"http://toidiu.com/gin/":{"body":"i like gin\n","id":"http://toidiu.com/gin/","title":"gin"},"http://toidiu.com/projects/":{"body":"","id":"http://toidiu.com/projects/","title":""},"http://toidiu.com/projects/1-second-everyday/":{"body":"Record a video or image everyday and then compiles the collection into a video.

In terms of a caching, this means to take item (i), hash it (good distribution) and then assign it to the available caches (C), maybe with modulo: hash\\_fn(i) % C. There are two problems with this approach. First is that the distribution is a function of the servers, so as we add or remove servers, we now need to recalculate the modulo and therefore the distribution. The second problem, which derives from the first, is that now each server node now needs to be updated - said differently, each server node now needs to be aware of every node. Consensus is hard, so this is not ideal.\nSection 4 contained proof and discussion of Consistent Hashing.\nThe authors define 4 properties that define their notion of consistency: balance requires that the hash function distribute the objects in a balanced fashion amongst the buckets. monotonicity says if items are initially assigned to a set of buckets and then some new buckets are added, then an item may move from an old bucket to a new bucket, but not from one old bucket to another. spread implies that references for a given object are only directed to a small number of caching machines. load implies that no one cache is assigned an unreasonable number of objects.objects.\nNext they define some properties of a good ranged hash function: Given Rb(hash for buckets) and Ri(hash for items). An item i should be assigned to the closest bucket. Given max of C buckets. For each bucket create k*log(C), some constant k virtual buckets and map them using the hash function Rb. To save space, have Rb and Ri map to the range [0,1]. To differentiate a point from another, we only needs to have log(number of points) random bits (decimal precision) identifying a point.\nLastly they share an efficient implementation of a possible consistent hash function: Use a balanced binary search tree to store the buckets and their assignment in the range. If there are C buckets, then there will be k*C*log(C) entries, which gives a worse tree depth of log(C) and a worse possible calculation of log(C). The time for adding and removing a bucket is log^2(C) since we would need to remove k*log(C) points. To reduce this time to constant lookup, the authors suggest dividing the range into k*C*log(C) equal length segments and have a separate tree for each one. This allows us to more predictably have one bucket per segment. The problem with segments is that it requires smaller segments as more buckets are added. An amortized way recommended by the authors is to choose intervals of size 1/2^x such that 1/2^x &lt; 1/k*C*log(C). Then as new buckets are added, gradually bisect each section.\n","id":"http://toidiu.com/reads/consistent-hashing/","title":"Consistent Hashing and Random Trees: Distributed Caching Protocols for Relieving Hot Spots on the World Wide Web"},"http://toidiu.com/reads/flp/":{"body":"Despite being a short paper, the proofs themselves were pretty confusing. This post was critical for my understanding.\nThe proof is comprised of two lemmas. The first lemma showed that there must be some initial configuration where consensus is not yet determined (caused by errors or message delays). Think of this as bivalent (having two possible truths) state. The second lemma shows that it is always possible to remain in a bivalent state by delaying a message.\nLets note the assumptions made by the proof: The underlying transport protocol is reliable; messages are delivered correctly and exactly once. There is no synchronized clock, and it is not possible to detect a slow process vs a dead process. Additionally, the proof relaxes the termination requirement and requires that only some process eventually decide on a value (weak consensus). Put another way, a message will always be delivered but can be delayed and can be delivered out-of-order.\nFor Strong Consensus these 3 properties must hold: termination: eventually, every correct process decides some value. agreement: all processes that decide do so on the same value. validity: the value must have been proposed by some process.\n","id":"http://toidiu.com/reads/flp/","title":"Impossibility of Distributed Consensus with One Faulty Process"}},"docInfo":{"http://toidiu.com/":{"body":1,"title":1},"http://toidiu.com/blog/":{"body":1,"title":0},"http://toidiu.com/blog/a-practical-guide-to-breakout/":{"body":168,"title":3},"http://toidiu.com/blog/android-low-memory-testing/":{"body":147,"title":4},"http://toidiu.com/blog/announcing-reads/":{"body":29,"title":2},"http://toidiu.com/blog/learning-scala/":{"body":418,"title":2},"http://toidiu.com/blog/polymorphism-in-scala/":{"body":915,"title":2},"http://toidiu.com/blog/understanding-lambda-in-rust/":{"body":303,"title":3},"http://toidiu.com/gin/":{"body":1,"title":1},"http://toidiu.com/projects/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://toidiu.com/projects/1-second-everyday/":{"body":16,"title":3},"http://toidiu.com/projects/consistent-rs/":{"body":6,"title":2},"http://toidiu.com/projects/dkv/":{"body":15,"title":1},"http://toidiu.com/projects/fieldbook/":{"body":20,"title":1},"http://toidiu.com/projects/learn-rust/":{"body":8,"title":2},"http://toidiu.com/projects/minibar/":{"body":16,"title":1},"http://toidiu.com/projects/mta-status/":{"body":21,"title":3},"http://toidiu.com/projects/oystour/":{"body":10,"title":1},"http://toidiu.com/projects/persistent-graph/":{"body":7,"title":2},"http://toidiu.com/projects/postgres-mapper/":{"body":13,"title":2},"http://toidiu.com/projects/rust-lang/":{"body":8,"title":2},"http://toidiu.com/projects/swig/":{"body":12,"title":1},"http://toidiu.com/projects/toidiu-fs/":{"body":7,"title":1},"http://toidiu.com/reads/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://toidiu.com/reads/consistent-hashing/":{"body":262,"title":13},"http://toidiu.com/reads/flp/":{"body":108,"title":6}},"length":26}};
