I am starting an ongoing section here called [reads](/reads).
<!-- more -->

The task will be to read, highlight and summarize a paper, and possibly a coded implementation. The primary goal of this project is to reference my thoughts, and also gain a better understanding of the topic in the process. Possibly other might also find this useful.
